Data Removal Automation (Opt-Out Requests)
Description: The Data Removal Automation tool is designed to help users protect their privacy by automating the process of opting out of data broker websites that collect and sell personal information. Many websites and services aggregate public data and make it accessible for a fee, which could result in your personal information being exposed online. This tool streamlines the opt-out process, saving you time and effort when requesting that your information be removed from these sites.

Key Features:
Automated Opt-Out: The script uses Selenium to automate form submissions on popular data broker websites such as Spokeo, Whitepages, and MyLife, where possible.
Pre-filled Email Templates: For sites that require manual opt-out requests via email, the script generates pre-filled email templates containing your personal details, making it easier to submit the request.
Customizable: You can easily extend the script by adding more sites to the list or modifying the form-filling logic to accommodate different data brokers.
Simple Command-Line Interface: The tool provides an easy-to-follow command-line interface (CLI) that guides users through the opt-out process.
Supported Data Broker Sites:
Spokeo
Whitepages
MyLife
(More sites can be added as needed)
How It Works:
Select a data broker from the list.
If the site supports automation, the script will automatically fill out and submit the opt-out form.
If the site requires manual action, the script will provide an email template for you to send a request to have your data removed.
Protect your personal information and take control of your online privacy.
